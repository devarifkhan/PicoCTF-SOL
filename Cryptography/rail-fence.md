## Question
> A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described here. Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it? Download the message here. Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, picoCTF{decoded_message}.

## Solution
> This is rail fence cipher text.I will use [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/rail-fence-cipher) to decrypt the cipher and the shift will be 4 and you will get the flag.


> Flag is: picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7}
